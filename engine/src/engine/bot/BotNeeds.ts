 * Answers "what does this bot need before it can do X?" and
 * "can it afford what it needs?"
 *
 * Import chain: Player → BotAction → BotWorld (no cycle with World.ts)
 *
 * Key fixes vs original:
 *   - STARTING_COINS raised to 1000 (fighters need sword + scimitar upgrade)
 *   - getMissingPurchases now checks affordability per item
 *   - canAffordStep accounts for quantity × cost on bulk consumables
 *   - Added totalCostOfPurchases helper used by BotGoalPlanner

 *   Skiller:  bronze axe (16) + net (5)                           =   21gp
 *   Fighter:  bronze sword (32) + iron scimitar later (200)       =  232gp
 *   Ranged:   oak shortbow (200) + 100 bronze arrows (100 × 7gp)  =  900gp
 *   Magic:    staff of air (unknown) + 100 mind runes (100 × 4gp) =  400gp+
 * 1000gp covers all starting gear with a comfortable buffer.
