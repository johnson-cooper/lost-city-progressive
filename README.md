## 🛠️ Features in Detail

### Bot Progression System
Bots autonomously progress through the skill system with:
- **Intelligent task selection** based on current level and available resources
- **Resource management** (banking, inventory management, item acquisition)
- **Optimal pathing** with gate awareness and world navigation
- **Magic teleportation** with visual cast animations
- **Activity-specific AI** (combat targeting, resource respawn detection, etc.)

### Gate & Door Awareness
Bots intelligently:
- Detect closed gates, doors, and barriers within 10 tiles
- Open gates directionally (toward their destination)
- Automatically handle AL Kharid tolls, Karamja boats, and similar gated regions
- Adapt routes when paths are blocked

### Dynamic Hiscores
- Real-time skill level tracking across all 19 skills
- XP-based rankings with visual displays
- Player vs. bot competition leaderboards
- Historical progress tracking

## 📚 Development

### Building from Source

# Start development server
bun run dev

# Run tests
bun run test

# Build for production
bun run build:prod
```

### Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Follow the code style** (TypeScript, 2-space indents, clear naming)
3. **Test thoroughly** before submitting a pull request
4. **Document changes** in commit messages and code comments
5. **Join our Discord** to discuss major features

### Code Style Guide

```typescript
// Use descriptive names
const isPlayerAdjacentToGate = true;

// Comment complex logic
// botTeleport defers the actual position jump by 2 ticks so the
// cast animation plays visibly at the source location first
export function botTeleport(player: Player, x: number, z: number, level: number): void {
    // Implementation
}

// Use JSDoc for public APIs
/**
 * Opens the nearest closed gate within radius tiles, or walks toward it.
 * Returns true if a gate was found and an action was queued.
 */
export function openNearbyGate(player: Player, radius = 30): boolean {
    // Implementation
}
```
